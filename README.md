# MobWeb_CustomerGroupByCouponCode extension for Magento

This Magento extension allows you to link your store's coupon codes to a customer group. When a customer uses that specific coupon code while checking out or signing up, the customer will automatically be assigned to that customer group.

## Questions? Need help?

Most of my repositories posted here are projects created for customization requests for clients, so they probably aren't very well documented and the code isn't always 100% flexible. If you have a question or are confused about how something is supposed to work, feel free to get in touch and I'll try and help: [info@mobweb.ch](mailto:info@mobweb.ch).
